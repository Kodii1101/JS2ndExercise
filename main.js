//challenge question from Mr. Charlie Yabes
/* Help me to answer. ðŸ˜­
As a future athlete you just started your practice for an upcoming event. Given that on the first day you run x miles, and by the event you must be able to run y miles.
Calculate the number of days required for you to finally reach the required distance for the event, if you increases your distance each day by 10% from the previous day.
Print one integer representing the number of days to reach the required distance. */
